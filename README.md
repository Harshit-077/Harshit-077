##  Fun Facts
- If given a choice, I'd rather be **invisible** than fly.  
- Coding sessions are best fueled by Hans Zimmerâ€™s **"Cornfield Chase"**.  
- I once coded right after recovering from a serious fever (no pain, no gain!).

##  What's Next
- Deep diving into **System Design** and architecture patterns.
- Building **accessible and scalable web applications**.
- Continuing **open-source contributions** â€” especially through GSSoC and community-based projects.

Thank you for stopping by! Letâ€™s build something meaningful.
